### Recursion

1. Strings based on Number.

>Lets assume A is 1, B is 2…and Z is 26. Given a number N, print all possible strings based on above. E.g: 1234 -> ABCD, LCD, AWD

2. Phone Keypad possible Strings.

>Using the phone keypad return all possible words that can be produced given input digits. e.g. 23 > “ad, ae, af, bd, be, bf, cd, ce, cf”


3. Rules for strings


>Suppose you have a string made up of only the letters 'a' and 'b'. Write a recursive function that checks if the string was generated using the<br>
following rules:
* The string begins with an 'a'
* Each 'a' is followed by nothing or an 'a' or "bb"
* Each "bb" is followed by nothing or an 'a'

4. Subset Sum Problem

>Given an array and a number N, find all subsets which sum up to N. (pairs,triplets, etc.)

5. Strings based on number

>Lets assume A is 1, B is 2…and Z is 26. Given a number N, print all possible strings based on above. E.g: 123 -> ABC, LC, AW
